        It's Barnil Sarma repping from NIT Silchar, deep in the trenches of my
        third year in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Ever since day
        one, I've been working hard with all things tech. Right now, I'm diving
        headfirst into the wild world of Web Development. As for hobbies,I love
        listening to music, strumming the guitar to get better at it. Football's
        my go-to for refreshment, whether playing or catching a match. And I
        enjoy jumping into quiz competitions when I can.
